    <p>What is brisket? A cut of beef that needs to be cooked slowly to break down the connective tissues. The unique thing about this cut of beef is that it can be slow cooked so it’s fork tender, yet is still sliceable. It also has a better beefy flavour compared to other slow cooking beef cuts like chuck.</p>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix Rub ingredients. Rub all over brisket. If time permits, leave for 30 minutes – 24 hours in the fridge, but I rarely do this</li>
        <li>Combine BBQ Sauce ingredients in a slow cooker. Mix then add the brisket</li>
        <li>Slow cook in slow cooker for 8 hours (1.5 kg / 3 lb) to 10 hours (2 kg / 4 lb). (Note 2 for pressure cooker and</li>
        <li>Remove brisket onto a tray</li>
        <li>Pour liquid in slow cooker into a saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium high heat and reduce until it thickens to a syrup consistency (it thickens more as it cools).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, drizzle brisket with oil then roast in a 200C/390F oven for 15 minutes until brown spots appear. Remove then baste generously with Sauce, then return to oven for 5 minutes. Remove and baste again, then return to oven for 5 – 10 minutes until it caramelises and looks like the photos. (See note for BBQ option)</li>
        <li>TO SERVE: Slice brisket thinly across the grain and serve with remaining BBQ Sauce. This is terrific served as a meal with sides or piled high onto rolls with Coleslaw as sliders. See Note 3 for more ideas.</li>

    <p>Today, I’m showing you an amazing method for smoking ribs: the fool proof 3 2 1 ribs recipe. This method has gained a lot of popularity with home cooks in recent years because of the flawless results in churning out super tender ribs that fall off the bone every time.</p>
<h3>Recipie</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Start with exposing the seasoned ribs to 3 hours of heavy smoke over low heat. I prefer fruit woods (apple or cherry) when smoking pork, but other hardwoods (hickory and alder) also work really well with ribs.</li>
    <li>After the initial 3-hour smoke, foil the ribs with a liquid of your choosing (I used apple cider, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, and 2-3 Tablespoons of butter) and cook at 225-250 degrees for 2 more hours. After the braising period I look for great retraction of the meat from the bones. I want the bones to be exposed on the end at least 1/4 to 1/2 an inch.</li>
    <li>Lastly, baste the ribs basted in your favorite BBQ sauce and return them to the grill for a final hour to hour and a half to finish the ribs and set the sauce</li>

    <p>Pork Belly Burnt Ends are super tender, full of flavor, and so easy to make. A delicious twist on classic brisket burnt ends, we smoke then braise our pork belly bites until they are tender and sweet. These morsels of goodness have developed the nickname “meat candy” for good reason.</p>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Smoke for three hours at 225 degrees Fahrenheit, or until you like the color of the meat. A nice bark will form starting around the three-hour mark. This can take longer based on so many factors like wind and how much bark you like. The key is, once you put it into the braising liquid, your bark is done forming</li>
        <li>Next, add the pork belly cubes to a pan (we like a heat-proof disposable pan). Into the pan add the braising liquid. We use BBQ sauce to really add that extra flavor (about 1 cup), 3-4 tablespoons of butter, which adds richness and acts as a fatty binding agent for bringing the sauce and honey together, and then 2 tablespoons of honey (or agave) to bring a stickiness and sweet characteristic. Then mix them all together.</li>
        <li>Then cover and braise in the smoker for another 60 – 90 minutes. You will find that the liquid braises at or near a boil and that the fat renders down in the pork belly burnt ends keeping the pan moist. Again, you have added additional fat in the butter, the honey as a binder, and the sauce for the flavor to really render out the fat that is in the pork belly. braise until the internal temperature of the bites are 200-205 degrees F. We always recommend using a good digital thermometer to check your temp</li>
        <li>Finally, remove the foil pan cover and cook for another 15 minutes to let the heat tack up that sauce, as you would with ribs or other sauced meats. Remove and eat some well-made pork belly burnt ends. It’s that simple. And that delicious!</li>
